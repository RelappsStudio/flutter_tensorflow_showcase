# tensorflow_showcase

How Flutter app can use tensorflow_lite to create and utilize on-device, offline AI models 

## Getting Started

There is a release available to download. If you want you can create your own binaries from source code

## Structure

Feel free to just download the packages separately to use & expand upon them

## Idea

For now this is just a demo of how much stuff can be connected to each other with one app & semi-clean code structure. Probably more intense changes are on the way if I will care enough to go back to this and create better file structure, make more universal controllers & such.


## Credits

Mostly package code is taken from https://github.com/tensorflow/flutter-tflite official TF repository.
